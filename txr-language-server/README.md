# 04 - Sending Notifications

> **Learning goal:** Learn how to send notifications to the client without a related request.

Messages from the server do not only have to be sent when requested by the client, the server can also send messages when it needs to notify the client of a change. The example we are using in this exercise is that of validation. Once the document is updated, we will validate that its content is correct and tell the client to display warnings/errors otherwise. We are beginning this sequence of calls when the server receives a `didChange` or `didOpen` notification, but using this technique, you can send the client notifications at any point.

## EclipseConTextDocumentService.java

When a file is opened or edited `didOpen` and `didChange` notifications are sent to the server respectfully. These are different from the other endpoints, such as the `completion` endpoint used in the second exercise, as they do not send back a response, instead the notification is used to update the responses that the other endpoints will send.
### Acquire The Client

To send notifications to the client, you first need a reference to the client. This is done with `EclipseConLanguageServer`'s `setRemoteProxy(LanguageClient)` function which is called by the client with a reference to itself and saves the client as the `client` variable in the `EclipseConLanguageServer` instance.

### Send the Notification

In both `didOpen` and `didChange` functions, we will take the model generated and send it to the `validate` function. This will return any necessary `Diagnostic`s as a List which will be used to create a new `PublishDiagnosticsParams` which is then published to the client:
```
CompletableFuture.runAsync(() ->
	eclipseConLanguageServer.client.publishDiagnostics(
		new PublishDiagnosticsParams(params.getTextDocument().getUri(), validate(model))
	)
);
```
The server is able to tell the client to show a message, log a messages, and update its list of the server capabilities this way. To show to yourself that this works, we will create an irritating addition that will have the server tell the client to display a message each time a change is made to a file:
```
CompletableFuture.runAsync(() ->
	eclipseConLanguageServer.client.showMessage(new MessageParams(MessageType.Info, "THE FILE HAS BEEN EDITED"))
);
```

## Server in Action

With our new message being sent on updates, let's see the language server in action:
 - Right clicking on the `org.eclipsecon.languageserverplugin` project, use **Run as > Eclipse Application** to launch
 - Create a new file called `exer4.txt`
 - Open this file with the Generic Editor
 - Begin typing in the Editor
 - Observe the notification being displayed

### Congratulations! You have sent a notification from a Language Server in Java to its client!
